        We are deploying Interceptor Barriers at the mouth of the gullies and Interceptor Tenders to collect the waste.
        We now have barriers in 7 gullies, with the plan to expand to 11 in total. This is our first project using Interceptor Barriers and Tenders. 
        We are glad to be receiving such great support and momentum from our local partners and we look forward to advancing from pilot to full coverage soon.
